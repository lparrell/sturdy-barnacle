README for Development - Keep notes of name, date, time, files touched, and updates made

MS - 12/4/21 - 10:43pm - Two READMEs created - One for development, one to turn in with submission
MS - 12/8/21 - 1:54am - Initial changes to the input/output code. Sent discord message to confirm how we want to handle output, since it would require adding code to some methods that don't yet exist.
